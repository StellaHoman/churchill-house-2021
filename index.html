	<h2>Introdictoin</h2>
	<p><b>Churchill House</b>, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>

	<p>Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.</p>



	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Churchill House was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70 and construction was completed in 1971. The building is an example of the Late Twentieth-Century Brutalist Style (1960-) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form concrete.</p>

	<h2>Statement of Significance</h2>

	<p> Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
	<li>Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
</ul>
</p>

	<p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.</p>

	<p>The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.
